# Adversarial Behavior Analysis

This analysis examines how adversaries exploit implicit assumptions embedded
within system design.

Rather than relying on sophisticated exploits, many attacks succeed by
violating developer assumptions about execution order, data validity, or
authorization scope.

Understanding adversarial behavior in this context highlights why many
security failures evade conventional testing and code review.
