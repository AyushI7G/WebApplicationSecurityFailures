# Access Control Failure Modes

This experiment studies authorization failures resulting from inconsistent
or fragmented access-control logic.

## Focus Areas
- Route-level versus centralized authorization
- Role confusion and privilege escalation
- Forgotten or partially protected endpoints

## Research Questions
- How does authorization logic drift occur in real systems?
- Which architectural patterns increase access-control fragility?

Access-control failures are analysed as emergent properties of system
composition rather than isolated mistakes.
