# Authentication Failure Modes

This experiment studies authentication-related security failures arising
from system design decisions.

## Focus Areas
- Session lifecycle management
- Token reuse and invalidation
- Assumptions about authentication state

## Research Questions
- How do architectural choices influence authentication robustness?
- Which authentication failures arise from implicit assumptions rather than
  explicit bugs?

Observed failures are analysed in terms of trust boundaries and abstraction
leakage rather than individual implementation errors.
