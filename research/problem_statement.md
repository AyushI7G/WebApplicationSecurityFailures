# Problem Statement

Despite widespread adoption of secure frameworks, libraries, and best
practices, web application security failures remain pervasive. Many of
these failures are not caused by isolated implementation bugs, but instead
emerge from system-level design decisions, implicit assumptions, and
misaligned abstractions.

This project studies security failures in web applications as system-level
failure modes. Rather than cataloguing individual vulnerabilities, we focus
on how architectural choices, trust boundaries, and abstraction layers
interact to produce authentication, input-handling, and access-control
failures under adversarial conditions.

By analysing security failures through a systems lens, this work aims to
identify recurring failure patterns and root causes that are difficult to
detect through conventional testing or best-practice compliance alone.
