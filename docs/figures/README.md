# Figures and Diagrams

This directory contains figures and diagrams used to support system-level
analysis throughout the project.

Planned figures include:
- System architecture diagrams
- Trust boundary visualizations
- Failure-mode mappings across architectural variants
- Adversarial interaction flows

These figures are intended to clarify how security failures emerge from system
composition and design choices rather than isolated implementation errors.
