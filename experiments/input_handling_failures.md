# Input Handling Failure Modes

This experiment examines how web applications process and validate external
inputs under adversarial conditions.

## Focus Areas
- Partial or inconsistent validation
- Assumptions about data structure and encoding
- Trust in upstream input sanitization

## Research Questions
- How do abstraction layers affect input validation correctness?
- Which input-handling failures emerge only under adversarial manipulation?

Failures are mapped to implicit assumption and abstraction leakage categories.
