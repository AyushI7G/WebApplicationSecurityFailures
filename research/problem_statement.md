# Problem Statement

Despite widespread adoption of secure frameworks, libraries, and best practices, web application security failures remain pervasive. These failures are frequently attributed to implementation mistakes; however, many arise from deeper system-level properties, including architectural design decisions, implicit trust assumptions, and abstraction boundaries.

This project investigates security failures in web applications as system-level failure modes rather than isolated defects. Instead of cataloguing vulnerabilities, the focus is on understanding how architectural choices, trust boundaries, and abstraction layers interact to induce authentication, input-handling, and access-control failures under adversarial conditions.

By analysing security failures through a systems perspective, this work seeks to identify recurring structural patterns and root causes that persist across implementations and evade conventional testing or compliance-based security approaches.
