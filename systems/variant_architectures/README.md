# Architectural Variants

This directory contains alternative architectural designs that implement
the same functional requirements as the baseline system, but differ in how
authentication, authorization, and input handling responsibilities are
structured.

Each variant is designed to isolate specific design decisions in order to
study how they influence security failure modes.

The goal is not to identify a “correct” architecture, but to analyse how
different design choices lead to distinct classes of vulnerabilities.
